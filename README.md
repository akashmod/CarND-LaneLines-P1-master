### Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I have detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

To complete the project, two files were submitted: a file containing [project code](https://github.com/akashmod/Self_Driving_Cars-LaneLine_Detection/blob/master/P1.ipynb) and a file containing a brief [writeup](https://github.com/akashmod/Self_Driving_Cars-LaneLine_Detection/blob/master/Writeup.ipynb) explaining my solution. The code file is called P1.ipynb and the writeup file is writeup.md. There are several other folders in the repository. The test_images folder contains the images used for the testing of the code and the test_videos folder contained videos for the same purpose. The test_images_output folder and test_videos_output folder contain outputs from the code for the subsequent images and videos.

The project was undertaken under Udacity. The requirements for the completion of the project can be seen in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view)


The writeup provides a detailed response to the "Reflection" section of the rubric. There are three parts to the reflection:

1. Describe the pipeline

2. Identify any shortcomings

3. Suggest possible improvements

There are images in the writeup to demonstrate how the pipeline works.  

### The Project
---

You can use jupyter notebook to access the files in the project repository.

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, check out <A HREF="https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/basics-jupyter-notebook-and-python" target="_blank">Cyrille Rossant's Basics of Jupyter Notebook and Python</A> to get started.

Jupyter is an Ipython notebook where you can run blocks of code and see results interactively.  All the code for this project is contained in a Jupyter notebook. 

`> jupyter notebook`

A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.  Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.  Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the project.
